## 🛡️ About Me

Comptia Security + Certified Cybersecurity professional specializing in **incident response**, **digital forensics**, **security architecture**, and **application security**. I investigate complex security incidents, analyze threat indicators, and develop comprehensive security frameworks. My expertise spans breach investigation, risk management, vulnerability assessment, secure software development, and compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST).

**Unique Background:** Full-stack web development experience (React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL) combined with cybersecurity expertise enables me to secure applications from the ground up. I understand how developers think, how applications are built, and where vulnerabilities are introduced—making me effective in AppSec code review, security testing, and developer collaboration.

**Passionate about:** Protecting organizations through thorough investigation, proactive security measures, secure development practices, and evidence-based remediation strategies.
